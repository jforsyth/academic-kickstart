abstract = """This work in progress paper describes preliminary
results of a methodology used at three different universities to
explore students‚Äô perceptions of engineering through drawings.
One of the primary objectives of introductory and foundational
engineering courses is to help students develop a sense of identity
and belonging within the field of engineering, and understand
basic engineering knowledge and skills. Hence, it is crucial to
understand students‚Äô preconceptions of the engineering discipline
when they start their academic program. However, many students
entering the program have narrow preconceptions or limited
knowledge about the field. One challenge instructors face is how
to facilitate students‚Äô thinking about their own perceptions of
engineering in a meaningful way. A typical activity to help the
students understand their perceptions of the engineering
discipline is to ask them, ‚ÄúWhat is engineering?‚Äù However,
instructors have been frustrated by the lack of depth in students‚Äô
responses. This paper explores a different methodology to
understand students‚Äô perceptions of the engineering discipline by
taking an arts-informed approach; instead of writing down their
perceptions or talking with a peer, students are first asked to draw
a response to the question ‚ÄúWhat is engineering?‚Äù Data were
collected and analyzed using an arts-based open-coding approach.
Initial results provide a representation of students' preconceptions
about the discipline in terms of human, technical, process-based,
and holistic/global aspects, which provide further evidence that
arts-based methods are effective in capturing student deep
perceptions of the engineering discipline.
