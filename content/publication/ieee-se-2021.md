# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = """With the growth of wearable devices, professional athletes are frequently monitored during training and competition to assess athletic performance and devise improvements. While beneficial to athletes, these measures are often costly and unavailable in amateur sports. A user study was conducted to determine the efficacy of measuring the Reactive Strength Index (RSI) in amateurs by using low-cost off-the-shelf components. While results are favorable to prior work with athletes and custom hardware, additional evaluation is needed to identify error sources between the users and sensor systems within the study."""
