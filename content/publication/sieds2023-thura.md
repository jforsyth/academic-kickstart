abstract = """
Heart disease has become a major global health concern
that is affecting millions of people worldwide. The situation
is particularly critical in developing countries where the access to
medical facilities is limited. This barrier to health care leads to
increased fatalities from heart disease. Early diagnosis of cardiovascular
conditions can be lifesaving. However, personal medicalgrade
equipment can be expensive and not easily accessible for
people living in these areas. It is important to expand the same
level of medical care to these communities at an affordable price.
Our research aims to investigate the performance of a machine
learning model on a low-cost embedded system. This study will
evaluate the accuracy, run time, and overall performance of the
model in diagnosing cardiovascular diseases. The results will help
us determine the feasibility of using machine learning models for
classifying cardiovascular disease in low-cost embedded systems.
A selected machine learning model has been trained, modified,
and compiled into the embedded system. The model returns the
classification results based on preprocessed input data. Multiple
metrics are collected to measure the performance of the model
and the embedded system. The preliminary results are promising
with accuracy levels similar to the original model. If these results
hold up in multiple trials, it is expected that the machine learning
model for classifying cardiovascular diseases on the embedded
system will be practical and useful in extending affordable
medical care to developing countries.
