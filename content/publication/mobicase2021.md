# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = """Human activity recognition (HAR) has been adopting deep
learning to substitute well-established analysis techniques that rely on
hand-crafted feature extraction and classication techniques. However, the
architecture of convolutional neural network (CNN) models used in HAR
tasks still mostly uses VGG-like models while more and more novel architectures
keep emerging. In this work, we present a novel approach to
HAR by incorporating elements of residual learning in our ResNet-like
CNN model to improve existing approaches by reducing the computational
complexity of the recognition task without sacrificing accuracy.
Specifically, we design our ResNet-like CNN based on residual learning
and achieve nearly 1% better accuracy than the state-of-the-art, with
over 10 times parameter reduction. At the same time, we adopt the
Saliency Map method to visualize the importance of every input channel.
This enables us to conduct further work such as dimension reduction
to improve computational efficiency or finding the optimal sensor node(s)
position(s).
