# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = """In this paper we outline methods for extracting behav- ioral descriptions of interactive prototypes from elec- tronic storyboards. This information is used to help interdisciplinary design teams evaluate potential ideas early in the design process. Using electronic storyboards provides a common descriptive medium where team members from different disciplinary backgrounds can collectively express the intended behavior of their prototype. The behavioral information is extracted by a combination of visual tags applied to elements of the storyboard, analysis of storyboard layout, and natural language processing of text written in the frames. We describe this process, provide a proof of concept exam- ple, and discuss design choices in developing this tool."""
