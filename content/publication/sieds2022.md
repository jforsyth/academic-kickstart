abstract = """As automation is becoming more prevalent across
everything from military and healthcare settings to everyday
household items, it is necessary to understand the nature of
human interactions with these systems. One critically important
element of these interactions is user trust, as it can predict
automated systems' safe and effective use. Past research has
evaluated individuals' trust in automation through a host of
different assessment techniques such as self-report,
physiological, and behavioral measures. However, to date, there
has been little evaluation of the convergence across these
measures in a real-world environment. Convergence across
measures is a useful tool in understanding the mechanisms by
which a cognitive construct is impacted and providing greater
confidence that any single measure is evaluating what it
purports to measure. 

The present study used an autonomous
golf cart that drove participants to different locations around
the campus of James Madison University while a camera
recorded them. In addition, participants were given the AICPR
and TOAST to evaluate their complacency potential and
trust, respectively. Researchers coded videos for
verification/checking behaviors (i.e., participants looked at or
interacted with the GUI used to control the cart) and nervous
behaviors (i.e., bracing, fidgeting, etc.). Additionally,
environmental 'obstacles' such as pedestrians, food-delivery
robots, and construction were also coded for by watching a
front-facing camera. Results indicate a disconnect between the
self-report and behavioral measures evaluating trust. However,
there was a relationship between the coded nervous behaviors
and verification behaviors and a relationship between those and
the presence of obstacles. 

This lack of convergence across
measures indicates a need for future research to understand
whether this non-convergence represents shortcomings with the
measures themselves, the existing definition of trust as a
construct, or perhaps indicates that there is a nuance that can
be afforded by some measures over another.
