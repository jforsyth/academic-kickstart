abstract = """In this paper we illustrate the results of an open-ended SEAD (science, engineering, art, and design) course engaging mid- dle school students in design of smart products and services. Students engaged in integrative activities that had them re- searching and developing viable products, while considering the business, engineering, and design aspects. Final presen- tations of each teamâ€™s product prototype, design process, and business plans were presented to a group of local business ex- ecutives to critique on value proposition, viability, and market opportunity."""
