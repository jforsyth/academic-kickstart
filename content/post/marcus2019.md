![Stephen Mitchell at MARCUS 2019](/img/stephen-mitchell-marcus.jpg)

Sophomore JMU Engineering student and undergraduate researcher in the Wearable Computing Group, Stephen Mitchell, presented his initial research on measuring athlete performance at the 2019 Mid-Atlantic Regional Conference on Undergraduate Scholarship (MARCUS) at Randolph College. His work examines using low-cost inertial measurement units (IMU) to calculate an atheltic performance measure called the "Drop Jump Ratio". These IMUs are low-cost, light weight, and more mobile than traditional force plates used to calculate the drop jump ratio. 
More information can be found in his [abstract](/pdf/mitchell-marcus-abstract.pdf) and [poster](/pdf/mitchell-marcus-poster.pdf).

Stephen's work is supported through collaborations with [Dr. Stu Thompson](http://www.bucknell.edu/fac-staff/stu-thompson) in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Bucknell University and [Dr. Rosha Wunderlich](https://www.jmu.edu/biology/people/current-people/faculty/faculty-wunderlich.shtml) in the Department of Biology at JMU.
