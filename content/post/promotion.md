Based upon action by the JMU Board of Visitors on April 16th I have been promoted to Associate Professor of Engineering effective August 25th, 2021.

I greatly appreciate the guidance and support from my JMU Engineering colleagues over the last three years. Futhermore, a great debt is owed to the [undergraduate researchers](https://www.jasonforsyth.net/categories/undergraduate-research/) in the Wearable Computing Lab for this milestone. I thank you all.
