Based upon action by the JMU Board of Visitors I have been promoted to Associate Professor of Engineering effective August 25th, 2021. I greatly appreciate the guidance and support from my JMU Engineering colleagues over the last three years. Also, a great debt is owed to the [undergraduate researchers](https://www.jasonforsyth.net/categories/undergraduate-research/) in the Wearable Computing Lab for this milestone. I thank you all.
