I am co-author on two papers this year at ASEE. The first, a collaboration with my JMU colleagues on our sophomore engineering design course that creates human-powered vehicles for persons with limited mobility. Our paper “Engagement in Practice: Engaging with the Community One Bike at a Time” can be found here.

The second paper reports on previous work at York College with our freshman engineering experience and the results of a new integrative activity to cover electrical and computer engineering topics. Our paper “A Seven-week Module to Introduce Electrical and Computer Engineering to Freshmen Engineering Students ” can be found here.

Finally, I have been elected as the Program Chair for the ASEE 
Entrepreneurship and Engineering Innovation and division. I’m looking forward to reading all the abstracts and papers for the 2020 program in Montreal!
