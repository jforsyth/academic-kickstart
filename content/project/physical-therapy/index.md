The project will develop a novel wearable computing system for use in physical therapy and rehabilitation
exercises. Often patients undergoing physical therapy are prescribed a set of stretches and exercises to
strengthen an injured muscle group. While outside of the doctor’s office, the physical therapist cannot
observe if the activities are being performed correctly or if at all. Wearable computing solutions have
been developed that will allow human activities to be recognized. However, current approaches are
limited to specific arm and leg motions and not the broader set of activities that would be required in a
general tool usable by medical practitioners. The project would leverage existing machine learning and
human-computer interaction techniques to develop a custom wearable computing system tailored to
rehabilitation exercises of a particular patient. This system would create positive patient outcomes by
providing feedback to the patient and the physical therapist about the quantity and quality of therapy
activities performed.
