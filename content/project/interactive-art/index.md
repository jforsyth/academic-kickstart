My work with pervasive computing systems is not restricted to research activities. Over the last two years I have sought out multidisciplinary collaborations to create systems that merge engineering and artistic disciplines. These efforts have resulted in two collaborations with Peter Danko (Danko Designs) and Matthew Campbell (Nine6 Design). With Peter Danko, I worked to make responsive a table that he had designed. The goal was to have the table illuminated as someone approached and to be “inviting” into the space. This was shown in LSC Design for one month to receive feedback on the design and its interaction.

With Matthew Campbell we created an interactive installation for the York College Faculty Biennale. The installation, Take 499, combined mechanics, music, and computing to create a responsive installation that represented “time” through different mechanisms. Activated by physical touch, Take 499 would search for prime numbers and display them on ticker tape over time, all while adjusting the tempo of played music based upon the range of numbers found. This work brought my research into interdisciplinary design in practice as we had to balance the physical, computational, and user interaction aspects of the piece to create an aesthetically pleasing solution. A video show its operation can be viewed [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/aw978zr1ly47dtd/Take499.mpg?dl=0).
