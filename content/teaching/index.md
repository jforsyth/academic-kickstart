ENGR 112 – Engineering Decisions: Freshman engineering course focused on human-centered design, engineering decision making, and project management through a community-based project. Current applications use a tethered weather balloon to monitor environment conditions and create value for a local community stakeholder. Additional skills learned include MATLAB, SolidWorks, and Arduino with sensors and actuators.

ENGR 231 – Engineering Design: Sophomore engineering course teaching the fundamentals of engineering design process including stakeholder identification, design objectives, specifications, constraints, and preliminary design. Students develop a human-powered vehicle for persons with disabilities. End of the semester results in a preliminary design and the project is continued into the Spring. Additional topics covered include teaming, project management, static analysis, and machining.

ENGR 313 – Circuits and Instrumentation: Junior/senior course covering broad topics in DC/AC circuits and power analysis. Course prepares students for capstone work involving electronics and for the FE exam. Topics covered include: resistive circuit analysis, transistors, operational amplifiers, first-order circuits, second-order circuits, analog and digital filters, and phasor space analysis. Lecture topics are reinforced via weekly lab sessions and include two design-build projects throughout the semester.
