Jason Forsyth is an Assistant Professor of Engineering at James Madison University. He received his PhD from Virginia Tech in May 2015. His major research interests are in wearable/ubiquitous computing and engineering education. Previously he was an Assistant Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at York College of Pennsylvania from 2015 – 2018.

His wearable computing work develops safety systems that provide continuous monitoring and sensing to protect human life. Previous work examined the role of wearable pulse oximetry in protecting construction workers from carbon monoxide poisoning and developing a warning system for road-side workers and emergency personnel to estimate potential vehicle strikes. His current research interests focus on on-body human activity recognition and interactive machine learning for physical therapy patients and practitioners to increase exercise adherence and clinical evaluation.

Jason has significant experience engaging with students both inside and outside of the classroom. During his three years at York College of Pennsylvania, he taught courses across the engineering curriculum and specialized in microprocessors, embedded systems, and engineering capstone. As a graduate student at Virginia Tech, he taught a semester long interactive architecture workshop to 3rd year architecture students and a conference workshop for industrial designers using the Arduino prototyping kit. His research on engineering capstone student experiences has been frequently published at the ASEE National Conference.

Outside of the classroom, Jason was nominated for the New River Valley Leading Lights award for his work directing a tutoring program for disadvantaged middle and high school students. Additionally, his community-based capstone project to develop an automated greenhouse at a local elementary school was financially supported externally and internally through York College’s Great to Greater initiative and the York County Community Foundation.

Jason is the recipient of the 2012 Best Paper Award from IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering for working on wearable monitoring of carbon monoxide poisoning in construction workers.
